To get cluster ip:

minikube ip

Pods are not meant to be seen from outside of the cluster, so they are only accessible from inside the cluster by default.

//////////////////////////////

SERVICES:

Since pods are ephemeral and come/go/live/die/restart, services are there to make sure they are pointed at any instance of a pod, no matter if its restarted or what.... With a service, we CAN connect to the k8s cluster and the service will find whatever pod to fill a request.

Pod Labels:
We can set up a series of key/value pairs (one or more pair). For example, we can give a pod a label whos key is 'app' and value is 'webapp'. You can give any labels you want, it's up to you. When we create a service, we give it a selector (key/value pair), such as app:webapp - and the service will look for any pods that have that key/value pair. So for a service with 

selector:
  app:webapp

The service will look for any pods that have the label
app:webapp
